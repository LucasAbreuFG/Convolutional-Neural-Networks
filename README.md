## ðŸ“ƒ **About**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work aims to contribute, through software, to the study of **human emotions** detected through facial expressions. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that the application will act in a concise and relevant way in the behavioral analysis of an individualâ€™s emotions. The results are extracted from a series of still images sent to the image processor script and the software developed during the project uses Artificial Neural Networks concepts and was built using the **Python** programming language.
