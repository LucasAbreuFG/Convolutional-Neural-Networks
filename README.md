# Convolutional-Neural-Networks

This work aims to contribute, through software, to the study of human emotions detected through facial expressions. 
It is expected that the application will act in a concise and relevant way in the behavioral analysis of an individualâ€™s emotions. The results are extracted from a series of still images sent to the image processor script. 
The software developed during the project uses Artificial Neural Networks concepts and was built using the Python programming language.
